# networkedQDA QDA=(Qualitative Data Analysis)

connecting-REFI-QDA-and-LODcloud

Qualitative research seems rather network-shaped, so why not combine it with LODcloud via its REFI-QDA standard 
... and be able to query the combination?

More on REFI-QDA: https://www.qdasoftware.org/downloads-project-exchange/ (used by ATLAS.ti, Dedoose, f4analyse, MAXQDA, NVivo, QDAMiner, Quirkos and Transana)

Some inspiration from semantic web aka Linked Data aka Knowledge Graph:
- relations ... https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/NOTE-rdf11-primer-20140225/example-graph.jpg
- ... can be embedded in all sorts of documents ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFa
- and then queried with an open standard. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL
- Big parts of Wikipedia can be asked questions this way ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBpedia
- ... or actually a giant network or sources of which DBpedia is only one https://lod-cloud.net/
- Many vocabularies are used, many of which are in this list https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov
- DBpedia is trying to fit text into triples, where Wikidata starts with multi-lingual statements from the get-go https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikidata
- Many, many, many tools for entry, analysis, visualisation. At some point there will be atlas.ti-like tools built on this, but in the mean time atlas.ti users can still learn from it
